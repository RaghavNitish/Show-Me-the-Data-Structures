Why I chose the data structure I used

As this was a purely recursion-based project, I didn’t take use of any data structures to solve the problem posed in the project. 
I only used a list to keep track of all the paths which led to files with a particular suffix. In my recursive approach, I simply 
went over each item present in the parent pathway (given as the parameter), and checked to see if the item was a directory or a file. 
If it was a file, I checked if its suffix matched the suffix I was looking for. If it was a directory, I went inside it and checked the 
items inside as well. 


Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the find_files() function is O(n) as a result of the for loop on line 26. Apart from this for loop, all other 
lines take O(1) time to execute. The space complexity of the entire program is O(n). This is because we have an expanding list.
